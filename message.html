                Hey, NM Happy Birthday once again. First, How are you?? I hope you are well...No I hope you are
        better, and I hope you are not in an angry mood. Because whenever I tell you something, you are always in an
        angry mood. Don’t take itseriously. Jokes apart. 
        
        <br>
        <br>
        I want to talk to you, but you don’t want to talk with me. So,
        I am trying this one-way communication with you. I am not going to take so much time of your life. I want to tell
        you a few things.
        <br>
        <br>
        You already know that Why I am doing this? because I Love you...
        <br>
        <br>
        when you love someone, you create your life much more Beautiful. Like your family members, when your family loves,
        you just love them back. Doesn’t matter How you are? Where you are? What you are? Etc. They just love you. 
       <br>
       <br>
        Exactly
        like your family, I love you. Not because you are Intelligent or beautiful......sorry you are intelligent and
        beautiful but........ I have no words,there are billions of reasons. But I love you. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Do I love you?
        <br>
        <br>
        I can’t prove it
        because Love has no parameter it is about consistency. Like, currently you don’t love me right. I don’t know you
        love me or not but let’s assume that you don’t love me. So, you didn’t remember me, but I love you, that’s why I
        remember you after 5 years. How? because there is not even a signal day, I didn’t think about you. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This is about
        How much I love you. But there is no condition that when someone loves you, you must love them back. You can’t
        Love me because I remember your Birthday or any other things. But You can’t decide that in your mind. Like when
        you go to buy some clothes, you take some clothes and try them on and after that, if you like them, you buy them.
        At first impression, you don’t even love it. You just like it. So did you understand what I am trying to say, you
        just try me if you don’t like or love me, you just tell me I leave your life. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Finally, you don’t know How much
        future you’ve got, what’s gone is gone.There is absolutely nothing you can do about it. You have failed the
        exam. You have had a break-up with your boyfriend. You have had terrible things happen in the past but what’s gone
        is gone it’s in the past. And to spend your time focusing on the past is to spend the only thing that you’ve got.
        But Live right here right now because the time never stops running. This is all we’ve got. 
        <br>
        <br>
        “Yesterday is history,
        Tomorrow is a mystery But Today is a gift That is why it is called Present”
        <br>
        <br>
        So, Last but not least I only say one thing
        is “I Love You and Only You” just give me one chance.
